## The waf is designed by dr0psï¼Œand remould by Yale.
* It is the first K410ng's WAF.
* It is writed only in a few time,so I omitted comments.When I'm free, I will improve it again and add comments
* It can be used in some AWD competitions,but do mind that whether rules allowed you to deploy WAF.
*  the usage is same as other libs file,just include it in the begin of config.php or index.php
